Prompts:
--------

Now you have to start another section of this project. I want to build a new section in this From where Sub users can be made by generating the id and password from the application. 
1. You need to make a drop down option for Client(main user), Sub User, Admin in login.
2. You need to generate the password and id from the Sub users section in the application. The sub user section should come beside the invoices section. Keep the UI same. Don't change. 
3. Now In the sub users, when sub user logged in, they can see a dashboard in which there will be only net credit, net debit, Invoice revenue In & Out of that sub user. No need of showing current balance.
4. There will be expenses section, transactions section and Invoice section with functionality of same as like the main users. Now one thing will change that for every section, when the sub user want to add a expense or Transaction, there will be option of request expense, request transaction instead of Save expense, save transaction and also there will be a column where it will display ACCEPTED, REJECTED, PROCESSING. 
5. Now when sub user request a transaction or expense, the request will go to main user who created Sub user and they can accept, reject. If they accept then that particular transaction/ expense will be added to the main users account with the name of the sub user. 


Fixes need to be done:
----------------------

1. Expense deletion of Sub user, balance update of the main user
2. Invoice section OUT part approval -- DONE
3. Invoice balance fixture
